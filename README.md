# GAT315: Unity Physics Exploration

This repository contains coursework and experiments from **Neumont College of Computer Science’s GAT315** class, with this project focused on exploring **game physics in the Unity Engine**. The purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience with 2D and 3D physics simulations, Unity’s built-in physics systems, and the creation of simple physics-based games.

## Project Structure

### `3D/`
Explore the fundamentals of Unity's 3D physics system, including:

- Rigidbody dynamics and collisions  
- Force and impulse application  
- Physics materials and constraints  
- Fun with vehicles, ragdolls, and other physics-based prototypes

---

### `2D/`
Delve into Unity’s 2D physics engine with:

- Collision detection and Rigidbody2D  
- Tilemaps, UI integration, and basic AI  
- Building blocks for a functional 2D game

---

### `Breakout [CA]/` — *Physics-Based Game*
A small, original game created as the final project for the course. It brings together concepts from the 2D section to demonstrate:

- Player interaction with a physics-driven environment  
- Custom physics-based mechanics  
- Game polish: visuals, and basic UI
